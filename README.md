## **Backend Configuration**

### **1. Environment Variables**
Navigate to the `backend` folder and create a `.env` file. Add the following:

JWT_SECRET_KEY=
FRONTEND_URL=

# Cloudinary Variables
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

# Stripe
STRIPE_API_KEY=
```

### **2. MongoDB Setup**
- Sign up or log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- Create a cluster and database, then obtain your connection string.
- Add the connection string to `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` in your `.env` file.

### **3. Cloudinary Setup**
- Create an account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
- Obtain your **cloud name**, **API key**, and **API secret** from the dashboard.
- Add these details to the respective variables in `.env`.

### **4. Stripe Setup**

- Obtain your API key from the Stripe dashboard and add it to `STRIPE_API_KEY`.

### **5. JWT Secret**
- Generate a long, random string for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. Tools like [random.org](https://random.org) or other key generators can help.

### **6. Frontend URL**
- Set `FRONTEND_URL` to the location of your frontend app (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development).
